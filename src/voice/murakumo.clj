  "JVM I/O edge: submit/poll generation jobs against the REAL murakumo
  distributed generation backend (ADR-2607123000 §3), reusing
  `cloud-murakumo.gen`/`cloud-murakumo.queue-kotoba` verbatim (sibling
  gftdcojp repo, `:local/root` dep — see deps.edn) rather than re-deriving
  the job-normalization / kotoba-queue wire protocol here.

  HONEST LIMIT: this actor only SUBMITS jobs onto the `gftd-murakumo` kotoba
  graph and POLLS for completion — it does not itself run GPU inference. A
  murakumo fleet worker (`clojure -M:worker --kotoba-url https://kotobase.net
  --kotoba-graph gftd-murakumo`, running on a Mac-mini / `gad` node) has to be
  up and consuming that queue for jobs to ever leave :queued. Same
  operational dependency ai-gftd-apex already has on cloud-murakumo."

  sends, but reads have no CACAO to derive it from, so this must compute the
